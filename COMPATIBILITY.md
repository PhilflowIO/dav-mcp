# CalDAV/CardDAV Provider Compatibility

This document describes provider-specific behaviors, quirks, and workarounds discovered during testing with the tsdav MCP Server.

## Overview

While CalDAV (RFC 4791) and CardDAV (RFC 6352) are standardized protocols, real-world implementations differ due to:
- Optional RFC features ("MAY support" vs "MUST support")
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Vendor-specific extensions
- Performance optimizations

The tsdav library abstracts most differences, but some quirks affect user experience.

## Tested Providers

| Provider | CalDAV | CardDAV | Auth Method | Test Status | Overall Rating |

## Radicale (https://radicale.org/)

**Version Tested**: 3.x
**Test Date**: 2025-10-09
**Test Result**: 100% PASS (22/22 tools, 2042ms total)

### Strengths
- ‚úÖ **Fastest performance** - Average response time: ~2 seconds for full CRUD cycle
- ‚úÖ **Lightweight** - Minimal resource usage
- ‚úÖ **Simple setup** - Easy to deploy and configure
- ‚úÖ **Perfect compatibility** - All core CalDAV/CardDAV operations work flawlessly

### Known Quirks

#### 1. Calendar displayName Not Set on Creation
**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: User Experience

**What Happens**:
1. User creates calendar with `displayName: "My Personal Calendar"`
2. MCP tool sends MKCOL request with displayName in properties
3. Radicale creates calendar at URL: `https://radicale.../my-personal-calendar/`
4. Radicale **ignores displayName** and sets it equal to URL slug: `"my-personal-calendar"`

**Why It Happens**:
- RFC 4791 does not require servers to honor displayName during MKCOL
- Radicale's lightweight design sets displayName = URL path by default
- The displayName property is typically set via a separate PROPPATCH request

**Workaround**:
```javascript
// After creating calendar with make_calendar:
const calendar = await client.makeCalendar({ url, props: { displayName: "My Personal Calendar" } });

// Immediately update the displayName via PROPPATCH:
await updateCalendarTool({
  calendar_url: newCalendarUrl,
  display_name: "My Personal Calendar"
});
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ `update_calendar` tool works perfectly and fixes the displayName via PROPPATCH.

**User Impact**: Minimal - Users can simply use `update_calendar` after `make_calendar` to set the desired name.

---

#### 2. Component-Set Restrictions Ignored
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: None (actually beneficial)

**What Happens**:
- You create a calendar with `components: ["VEVENT"]` (events only)
- Radicale ignores this restriction
- You can still create VTODO (tasks) in the same calendar
- No error occurs

**Why It Happens**:
- Radicale's design philosophy: simplicity over strict enforcement
- RFC 4791 allows servers to ignore component-set restrictions

**Workaround**: None needed - this is actually a feature! It allows flexible use of calendars.

### Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Avg Time | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| list_calendars | ~150ms | Very fast |
| create_event | ~200ms | Instant feedback |
| calendar_query | ~180ms | Efficient filtering |
| update_calendar | ~120ms | PROPPATCH very fast |
| delete_event | ~100ms | Quick cleanup |
| **Full CRUD cycle** | **~2 seconds** | Fastest of all tested servers |

---

### Recommendations

**Best For**:
- ‚úÖ Personal calendars and contacts
- ‚úÖ Development and testing
- ‚úÖ Small teams (< 50 users)
- ‚úÖ Self-hosted lightweight deployments
- ‚úÖ Performance-critical applications

**Limitations**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No built-in web UI (use external clients)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal access control (file-based permissions)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No collaborative features (no shared calendars with ACLs)

---

## Baikal (https://sabre.io/baikal/)

**Version Tested**: 0.9.x
**Test Date**: 2025-10-09
**Test Result**: 100% PASS (22/22 tools, 1977ms total)

### Strengths
- ‚úÖ **Excellent performance** - Slightly faster than Radicale
- ‚úÖ **Web UI included** - User management and calendar creation via browser
- ‚úÖ **Mature codebase** - Based on sabre/dav (widely used)
- ‚úÖ **Perfect CalDAV/CardDAV compliance** - No quirks discovered

### Known Quirks
- üéâ **None discovered!** All 22 tools work perfectly as expected.

### Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Avg Time | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Full CRUD cycle** | **~2 seconds** | Excellent performance |

### Recommendations

**Best For**:
- ‚úÖ Small to medium teams (< 200 users)
- ‚úÖ Users who want a simple web UI
- ‚úÖ Production deployments
- ‚úÖ Users migrating from proprietary solutions

**Perfect Score**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Baikal is the most reliable and straightforward CalDAV/CardDAV server tested.

---

## Nextcloud (https://nextcloud.com/)

**Version Tested**: 28.x
**Test Date**: 2025-10-09
**Test Result**: 100% PASS (22/22 tools, 23073ms total)

### Strengths
- ‚úÖ **Feature-rich** - Full collaboration suite (files, contacts, calendar, tasks)
- ‚úÖ **Active development** - Regular updates and security patches
- ‚úÖ **Large community** - Extensive documentation and support
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise-ready** - Scales to thousands of users

### Known Quirks

#### 1. Slower Performance
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: Response time

**What Happens**:
- Full CRUD cycle takes ~23 seconds (vs ~2 seconds for Radicale/Baikal)
- Individual operations are slower (300-500ms vs 100-200ms)

**Why It Happens**:
- Nextcloud is a full application suite, not just CalDAV/CardDAV
- Additional database queries for permissions, logging, notifications
- More complex architecture with plugins and apps

**Workaround**: None needed - performance is still acceptable for most use cases.

---

#### 2. Soft Delete Behavior
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: None (actually beneficial)

**What Happens**:
- When you delete an event, Nextcloud doesn't immediately remove the file
- The file is renamed to `deleted_event_123.ics` and moved to trash
- Users can restore deleted items from the web UI

**Why It Happens**:
- Nextcloud provides trash/restore functionality
- This is a feature, not a bug

**Workaround**: None needed - tsdav handles this transparently.

---

### Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Avg Time | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| list_calendars | ~500ms | Slower due to permissions checks |
| create_event | ~800ms | Includes notification system |
| calendar_query | ~700ms | Complex filtering |
| **Full CRUD cycle** | **~23 seconds** | Slowest, but feature-rich |

### Recommendations

**Best For**:
- ‚úÖ Organizations needing full collaboration suite
- ‚úÖ Teams with existing Nextcloud infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Users who need web-based calendar/contact management
- ‚úÖ Enterprise deployments (1000+ users)

**Considerations**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower than lightweight alternatives
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex setup and maintenance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher resource requirements

## iCloud (Apple)

**Status**: Known to work (not tested in this session)
**Auth**: Basic Auth with App-Specific Password

### Known Requirements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **App-Specific Password required** - Cannot use regular Apple ID password
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Two-Factor Authentication must be enabled**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **X-APPLE-CALENDAR-COLOR extension** - Custom color format

### Setup Instructions
1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication on Apple ID
2. Generate App-Specific Password at https://appleid.apple.com/
3. Use App-Specific Password in `CALDAV_PASSWORD` env var

---

## Google Calendar

**Status**: Not yet supported (requires OAuth2)
**Planned**: Phase 11.1 (v2.3.0+)

### Known Requirements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **OAuth2 required** - Basic Auth not supported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UID filename enforcement** - Event filename must match UID
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No UID reuse** - Cannot reuse UIDs of deleted events

### Workarounds (when OAuth2 is implemented)
- tsdav handles UID extraction and filename generation automatically
- No manual workarounds needed

---

## Summary & Recommendations

### For Personal Use
**Recommendation**: **Radicale** or **Baikal**
- Fastest performance
- Simple setup
- Perfect compatibility

### For Small Teams (5-50 users)
**Recommendation**: **Baikal**
- Built-in web UI
- User management
